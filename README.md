# happyNumbers
This is just a silly project droven by "can I do it?" thought

Some time ago on JoeMonster i read about happy numbers https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_number 
It's a perfect excercise after working with Spring, something light, no pressure.

### Tactic Plan
1. method that checks if given number is Happy
1.1 tdd
1.2 working method ignoring Big-O
2. terminal interface
2.1 after each result ask if user wants to try again or try something else
3. optimising method for better Big-O
4. finding closest Happy Number to number given by user
5. finding all happy Numbers in range given by user
6. method for finding happy Prime Numbers for all options
