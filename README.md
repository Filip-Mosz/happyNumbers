# happyNumbers
This is just a silly project droven by "can I do it?" thought

Some time ago on JoeMonster i read about happy numbers https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_number 
It's a perfect excercise after working with Spring, something light, no pressure.

### Tactic Plan
~~1. method that checks if given number is Happy
1.1 tdd~~
1.2 working method ignoring Big-O
2. terminal interface
2.1 after each result ask if user wants to try again or try something else
3. optimising method for better Big-O
4. finding closest Happy Number to number given by user
5. finding all happy Numbers in range given by user
6. method for finding happy Prime Numbers for all options
?. numbers n-happy (happy but when raised not to 2nd but n-th power)

I'm going to try TDD; I never really kept that principle, time was always short :( (so my skill)

Second thing to do is optimisation for better big-O notation result
